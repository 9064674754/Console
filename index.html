Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.

They are different from website builders and integrated development environments (IDEs) in that they do not assist in the direct creation of a webpage, rather they are tools used for testing the user interface of a website or web application.</p>
